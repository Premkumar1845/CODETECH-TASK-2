Overview of my project: Creating an interactive quiz application using JavaScript involves several key steps to manage questions, user interactions, scoring, and feedback. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the task:

1. Structure the Quiz (HTML)
Use basic HTML to create the layout for the quiz.
Each question will be presented in a section or container.
Use radio buttons or checkboxes for multiple-choice options.
Include navigation buttons like "Next", "Previous", and "Submit".
A results section at the end of the quiz to show the user's score.
2. Style the Quiz (CSS)
Use CSS to make the quiz visually appealing and easy to navigate.
Highlight the selected options and provide clear feedback styles for correct/incorrect answers.
Include hover effects for buttons and adjust layout for responsiveness.
3. Add Quiz Logic (JavaScript)
Questions Array: Create an array of questions, each with a prompt, options, and the correct answer.
Question Navigation: Handle moving between questions using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
Answer Handling: Use JavaScript to store selected answers for each question.
Scoring System: Compare the user's answers to the correct ones and calculate the score.
Feedback: Display immediate feedback after each answer (correct/incorrect) or at the end.
Results Display: Show the final score with a summary of correct/incorrect answers after the user clicks "Submit."
4. Key Features
Dynamic Question Loading: Load one question at a time using JavaScript, updating the content dynamically.
Answer Storage: Track user selections in real-time.
Score Calculation: Implement a scoring function to tally correct answers.
End Screen: Show a results page summarizing the user's performance and offering a restart button.
